# Spedup/Slowed down Music Video Maker

A Python script that automates the creation of nightcore-style/sped-up videos or slowed-down videos by combining anime wallpapers or cat wallpapers with audio extracted from YouTube videos.


2. Follow the prompts to enter the YouTube video URL, wallpaper choice, and speed preference.

3. The script will then download the video, extract audio, fetch the wallpaper, and combine them to create the nightcore-style video.

4. The final video will be saved in the `outputs` directory.
